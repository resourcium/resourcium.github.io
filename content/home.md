### Project Abstract

Problem Statement:
Within a university environment, student engagement and wellbeing is the key for success.
However, it can be the case that current systems lack the ability to manage student engagement.
We are working with UCL for this project in conjunction with Microsoft and IBM to develop a web
application that assists in data collection for what students like and need. 
It can be a series of micro apps or component functionality that can extend the app interface.
It will have a web portal as well as a cross platform mobile and app implementation. The system needs to be generic enough to work for several universities. A native approach for the cross-platform is not required, it should be responsive enough to adapt.
