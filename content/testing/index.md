## Testing Strategy

Our project is a mixture of tools and code. For example, we use Microsoft Flows and SharePoint which would require manual testing whereas for the codebase, which refers to the actual web application itself, it was full of automated testing.
To simplify, we used the following test methods:
- Unit testing and Integration Testing
- Performance Testing
- Responsive Testing
- Compatibility Testing
- User Acceptance Testing

Unit tests and integration tests have been applied where appropriate in the codebase, for example performing snapshot testing which automatically checks whether or not the page that we want is rendered correctly. Unit tests were used to test API calls to ensure that no error is produced when trying to get data from the API, since our system uses quite a few (namely Microsoft Graphs, Linkedin Learning and Microsoft Learn).

### Integration and Unit Testing

#### TODO SHOW PIC OF THE TESTS PERFORMED AND WRITE UP ABOUT IT

### Performance Testing

#### PIC + WRITEUP FOR THIS?

### Responsive Testing

#### Show different views of our app (one for tablet, mobile and laptop)

FILLER

### Compatibility Testing

#### Test with different browsers and devices (android + ios + windows)

FILLER

### User Acceptance Testing

#### Test with users around 5-6

FILLER - REPLACE THIS WITH RESULTS FROM THE FORMS HANDED IT AND SUMMARISE THE RESULTS

#### Feedback from client

We are pleased to say that our client, Dean and our project partner, Lee Stott (Microsoft) are satisfied with the application we have developed, considering its a first generational system.

### Manual Testing for the SharePoint and Microsoft Flows

Since this part of the system cannot be automated for testing, we performed manual testing. This involved us putting the Flow into the testing stage and manually submitting requests to it, in order to ensure the flows run. Below are example videos on how the test flows were run:
