<h4 id="potential-liabilities">Potential liabilities</h4>
<p>As a group we only have the following liability due to the nature of our project (due to it being open source and deployable by other universities):
<br />
Our first and only liability is that we need to complete and deliver this project/codebase to our clients by the specified deadline which is
24th March 2021. The final requirements is delivering code that can be deployed onto their own Azure system. Overall the key components would
be the login system, the student registration page, a page for students to access resources which contains a QnA bot as well as a page for student
to fill out forms where this data would be stored in a centralised Sharepoint site. In order to achieve the above features, we have set milestones so our
progress can be supervised and as long as we keep up with the plan, the project should finish on time.</p>
<h4 id="intellectual-property-type">Intellectual Property Type</h4>
<p>The most appropriate intellectual property type for this project would be the Creative Commons License. This is because the purpose of the CC license is to grant
some or all reserved rights to others. Whereas a trademark is for a identifiable name and a patent is to protect an original idea. The aim of this system is to be a baseline
for other universities to use and extend upon. Our project does not need a identifiable name (though we have called the app UCL Resourcium) as we will not be very famous. Additionally,
a lot of our system is dependent on other 3rd party services and systems, which requires us to learn from them, the work cannot be patented.
<br />
<br />
With regards to open source materials and implementations, we have made use of many open source libraries built-in to Node and React. All those libraries are under the open source
license and are free for editing. All images that we have used are either open source or made by us. To use some of the features, a license is required for example Microsoft Flow. The necessary licenses, subscriptions and costs will be detailed in the 'Manufacture Process and Deployment Costing'. Below are the libraries we have used with their respective licenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>React library (useState and useEffect) -&gt; Open Source (MIT)</li>
<li>ReactTwitchEmbedVideo -&gt; Open Source (MIT)</li>
<li>QRCode -&gt; Open Source (MIT)</li>
<li>SVG Icons on navigation bar + fontawesome library -&gt; Open Source (MIT)</li>
<li>MS Bot Framework -&gt; Open Source (MIT)</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code agreement that is the most logical is open source. Firstly, the aim of the application is to solve student engagement and wellbeing issues within a university environment which is not limited to just UCL. There is no data or packages on the system that prevent it from being shown freely. This means that other universities can download it, use it and distribute it to others. In our case our open source software will be free to be used. An appropriate sub category of open source this would fall under is the MIT license. This type of license is one of the most
permissive licenses available. Copies of the software can be made but a copy of the MIT license and copright notice must be added to it.
</p>
<h4 id="data-privacy-and-gdpr">Data privacy and GDPR</h4>
<p>The main concern for data privacy is the usage of student data when they login through our system. We use Microsoft Graphs to get some of their basic profile information which we then use to
personalise the application. Additionally we have user settings and preferences also stored in a separate database within Azure.</p>
<p>Firstly, we promote data privacy which means we know we need to keep student data private within the application. Hence, the student will need to provide us with permissions before they log into
our application. In our application, there is no storage of the users details, in fact all of it comes from the API call, and is only used for the session. </p>
<p>Secondly, we have made sure to use appropriate methods to process data. We have control of where and how the data is processed. The data with regards to the ticketing system is stored in a Sharepoint site which is managed by the university, hence our app does not use this data at all. Additionally, data such as user settings is again stored into the universities Azure account.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we have made sure to use as minimal data as possible to implement this application. For example, in user settings we only store the userID and their colors/schemes/views. In the case
of the ticketing system, our system only stores their email address and the help they require within a university Sharepoint site.</p>
<p>To conclude, our application does not have a data privacy concern as our application does not store data interally. It is all passed onto the university servers (Azure and Sharepoint) to be processed. As long as the university follow the GDPR laws too, there should not be a problem.</p>
<h4 id="manufacture-process-and-deployment-costing">Manufacture process and deployment costing</h4>
<p>Since our system is based off the cloud and many Azure services as well as other subscriptions. Universities will need be a tenant with Microsoft, they will need access to Microsoft 365 including MS Forms, MS Flows Premium, MS Sharepoint. Subscriptions for LinkedinLearning and Microsoft Learn will also be required for it to be usable by the application.
Below is the cost list for each individual part of the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure functions:  $0.20 per million executions and $0.000016/GB-s (GB-s is RAM used times seconds executed)</li>
<li>Cosmos db: $0.008/hour per 100 requests</li>
<li>MS Flows: £15 per month (per user plan)</li>
<li>QnABot: First 10,000 messages are free, then every 1000 premium message costs £0.37 (estimated)</li>
<li>QnAMaker resource: Free option (3 transactions per second) or paid option ($10 per month for unlimited documents)</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot estimate the full cost for the client to run the application as we do not know at what scale the application will be used. We would need statistics and data to perform accurate estimates.</p>
<h3 id="compliance-of-ada-and-wcag-2-2">Compliance of ADA and WCAG 2.2</h3>
<p>The software also follows the key points of the high compliance systems interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system can be viewed by those with colour deficient vision</li>
<li>Colour is used redundantly</li>
<li>Moving text is avoided, or where used it freezes to allow ease of reading</li>
<li>The sites uses a single, clear legible font</li>
<li>There is sufficient contrast between text and background colours</li>
<li>The pages have logical tab orders through all screen elements</li>
<li>Each page has a descriptive title</li>
<li>The system avoids blinking and flickering</li>
<li>The system uses common web conventions</li>
<li>The system uses pop-up windows appropriately
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application-end-user-license-agreement-eula">Application End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h3>
