following liability due to the nature of our project (due to it being open source and deployable by other universities):\n\nOur first and only liability is that we need to complete and deliver this project/codebase to our clients by the specified deadline which is\n24th March 2021. The final requirements is delivering code that can be deployed onto their own Azure system. Overall the key components would\nbe the login system, the student registration page, a page for students to access resources which contains a QnA bot as well as a page for student\nto fill out forms where this data would be stored in a centralised Sharepoint site. In order to achieve the above features, we have set milestones so our\nprogress can be supervised and as long as we keep up with the plan, the project should finish on time.\nIntellectual Property Type\nThe most appropriate intellectual property type for this project would be the Creative Commons License. This is because the purpose of the CC license is to grant\nsome or all reserved rights to others. Whereas a trademark is for a identifiable name and a patent is to protect an original idea. The aim of this system is to be a baseline\nfor other universities to use and extend upon. Our project does not need a identifiable name (though we have called the app UCL Resourcium) as we will not be very famous. Additionally,\na lot of our system is dependent on other 3rd party services and systems, which requires us to learn from them, the work cannot be patented.\n\n\nWith regards to open source materials and implementations, we have made use of many open source libraries built-in to Node and React. All those libraries are under the open source\nlicense and are free for editing. All images that we have used are either open source or made by us. To use some of the features, a license is required for example Microsoft Flow. The necessary licenses, subscriptions and costs will be detailed in the 'Manufacture Process and Deployment Costing'. Below are the libraries we have used with their respective licenses:\n\nReact library (useState and useEffect) -&gt; Open Source (MIT)\nReactTwitchEmbedVideo -&gt; Open Source (MIT)\nQRCode -&gt; Open Source (MIT)\nSVG Icons on navigation bar + fontawesome library -&gt; Open Source (MIT)\nMS Bot Framework -&gt; Open Source (MIT)\n\nThe source code agreement that is the most logical is open source. Firstly, the aim of the application is to solve student engagement and wellbeing issues within a university environment which is not limited to just UCL. There is no data or packages on the system that prevent it from being shown freely. This means that other universities can download it, use it and distribute it to others. In our case our open source software will be free to be used. An appropriate sub category of open source this would fall under is the MIT license. This type of license is one of the most\npermissive licenses available. Copies of the software can be made but a copy of the MIT license and copright notice must be added to it.\n\nData privacy and GDPR\nThe main concern for data privacy is the usage of student data when they login through our system. We use Microsoft Graphs to get some of their basic profile information which we then use to\npersonalise the application. Additionally we have user settings and preferences also stored in a separate database within Azure.\nFirstly, we promote data privacy which means we know we need to keep student data private within the application. Hence, the student will need to provide us with permissions before they log into\nour application. In our application, there is no storage of the users details, in fact all of it comes from the API call, and is only used for the session. \nSecondly, we have made sure to use appropriate methods to process data. We have control of where and how the data is processed. The data with regards to the ticketing system is stored in a Sharepoint site which is managed by the university, hence our app does not use this data at all. Additionally, data such as user settings is again stored into the universities Azure account.\nThirdly, we have made sure to use as minimal data as possible to implement this application. For example, in user settings we only store the userID and their colors/schemes/views. In the case\nof the ticketing system, our system only stores their email address and the help they require within a university Sharepoint site.\nTo conclude, our application does not have a data privacy concern as our application does not store data interally. It is all passed onto the university servers (Azure and Sharepoint) to be processed. As long as the university follow the GDPR laws too, there should not be a problem.\nManufacture process and deployment costing\nSince our system is based off the cloud and many Azure services as well as other subscriptions. Universities will need be a tenant with Microsoft, they will need access to Microsoft 365 including MS Forms, MS Flows Premium, MS Sharepoint. Subscriptions for LinkedinLearning and Microsoft Learn will also be required for it to be usable by the application.\nBelow is the cost list for each individual part of the app:\n\nAzure functions:  $0.20 per million executions and $0.000016/GB-s (GB-s is RAM used times seconds executed)\nCosmos db: $0.008/hour per 100 requests\nMS Flows: £15 per month (per user plan)\nQnABot: First 10,000 messages are free, then every 1000 premium message costs £0.37 (estimated)\nQnAMaker resource: Free option (3 transactions per second) or paid option ($10 per month for unlimited documents)\n\nWe cannot estimate the full cost for the client to run the application as we do not know at what scale the application will be used. We would need statistics and data to perform accurate estimates.\nCompliance of ADA and WCAG 2.2\nThe software also follows the key points of the high compliance systems interfaces:\n\nThe system can be viewed by those with colour deficient vision\nColour is used redundantly\nMoving text is avoided, or where used it freezes to allow ease of reading\nThe sites uses a single, clear legible font\nThere is sufficient contrast between text and background colours\nThe pages have logical tab orders through all screen elements\nEach page has a descriptive title\nThe system avoids blinking and flickering\nThe system uses common web conventions\nThe system uses pop-up windows appropriately\n\n\nApplication End-User License Agreement (EULA)\n\nWith no contract provided from UCL (our client), we drafted this EULA to protect our intellectual property as well as our client's.\nEnd-User License Agreement (\"Agreement\")\nLast updated: March 13, 2020\nPlease read this End-User License Agreement carefully before using the UCL Resourcium Application.\nInterpretation and Definitions\n\nInterpretation\nThe words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined\nunder the following conditions.\nThe following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether\nthey appear in singular or in plural.\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this End-User License Agreement:\n\nAgreement means this End-User License Agreement that forms the entire\nagreement between You and the Company regarding the use of the\nApplication.\nApplication means the software web application provided by Hemil Shah, Pritika Shah\nand Louis De Wardt available via a website.\nHemil Shah, Pritika Shah &amp; Louis De Wardt (referred to as either \"the Company\", \"We\",\n\"Us\" or \"Our\" in this Agreement) refers to UCL Resourcium Web app.\nContent refers to content such as text, images, or other information that\ncan be posted, uploaded, linked to or otherwise made available by You,\nregardless of the form of that content.\nCountry refers to: United Kingdom\nDevice means any device that can access the web Application such as a\ncomputer, a cellphone or a digital tablet.\nThird-Party Services means any services or content (including data,\ninformation, applications and other products services) provided by a\nthird-party that may be displayed, included or made available by the\nApplication.\nYou means the individual accessing or using the web Application or the\ncompany, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is\naccessing or using the Application, as applicable.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nBy using the web Application, You are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

One is the app which includes the react front-end and the Azure function back end, the deployment for which is nearly entirely automated by scripts in the deploy folder. The other is the Sharepoint side of our project for which automatic deployment is not possible. TODO: the \"Sharepoint\" deployment isn't just sharepoint and some of it is automated, this sentence should be fixed.\nI - The Sharepoint deployment\nThe Sharepoint deployment must happen before the app deployment as the app depends on URLs from the Sharepoint deployment. Below is the guide for SharePoint deployment:\nDeployment Guide\nII - The app deployment\nDependencies\n\nYou must have a copy of the source code for our app.\nYou must have access to a POSIX shell such as bash or zsh (this is not a requirement of the code but the specific steps and commands are different for example in Powershell, you may use other shells if you are experienced enough in them). On Linux of MacOS you can use your default shell, on Windows you should install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). \nYou must have python version 3 installed.\nInstall virtualenv (You can run pip install virtualenv, you must ensure that this is the pip for python3).\nInstall nodejs (which should come with npm) for you system. Make sure you install a recent LTS version.\nInstall terraform (a tested version is 0.14).\nInstall Azure CLI tools.\nInstall Azure function core tools, you can do this by running npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@3 --unsafe-perm true (npm should be installed when you installed node). You must install version 3.\nRun az login then login with the account that you want to deploy with (this account will own all the resources).\n(Optional) if you want to choose a specific subscription to run the deployment on: az account set --subscription &lt;subscription-id&gt;.\n\nApp configuration\nThe deployment of the app is configured using a file called app_config.yaml. It is configured so that it will not be stored in the git history as it may contain sensitive information. An example is found at app_config.yaml.example. You should copy this file and rename the copy to app_config.yaml. It must be stored in the root of the project. The example file is self documented.\nDeploy script\nThe next commands assume that you have a shell open in the deploy directory.\nBefore you begin the deployment script you must first setup the environment by running the setup_env.sh script. This will install the python dependencies for the script. To run the script you can run sh setup_env.sh or ./setup_env.sh. Once that's done you can enter the python virtual environment by running source env/bin/activate (NOTE: you can skip entering the virtualenv if pyyaml is installed globally, but this it not recommended).\nYou are now ready to run python deploy.py (again assuming that python3 is installed as python).\nIt will first check all the dependencies telling you if you need to install anything or run any commands. If everything is ready to go it will print out your deploy config and the subscription that it's going to deploy to, if it looks good you can type y and then hit enter.\nThe deployment of azure resources can take a very long time (sometimes multiple hours) so you need to be patient. You may be asked for confirmation later on, usually you can just accept.\nPost deployment\nAt the end of the deployment you are given the deployed URL of the app (future developers extending our app will allow for custom URLs to be given rather than long auto-generated ones).\nYou should create backups of the app_config.yaml file in the root and the file terraform.tfstate in the terraform folder. Both these files are hidden from the git history and both contain sensitive data and they are all that is required (apart from the source code) for redeployment/upgrades. If you do not save the terraform.tfstate and the app is updated you will have to create a new instance of the app (it will not update the old version).\nAt any time you are able to re-download our source code and then place app_config.yaml and terraform.tfstate in the correct locations and everything will work fine.\n","id":"/deployment/","title":"Deployment Guide"},"/evaluation/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis page explains the summary of achievements, critical evaluation of the project and future work.\nSummary of achievements\n\nAchievement Table for MoSCoW list\n\n\nList of known bugs\nThere is currently no known bugs, which we have identified during testing of the application. Our team used github issue tracker in order to keep track of bugs that we may have encountered\nduring testing or implementation stages. This helped to keep the bug list empty.\nIndividual contribution table\n\nCritical evaluation of project\n\nIn this section we will critically evaluate our project with respect to the following factors:\n\nUser interface: We have used a common system of having a navigation bar to go through the different pages. We also ensured that simplicity and readability were kept as the top target for the web application. Generally, the UI is easy to use as described by our testers. They are happy with how easily accessible everything is on the web application. We have put in a lot of work to make the system clean and user friendly. However, the only downside to the UI would be its desktop version. Responsive testing for different screen sizes suggests that even though the UI is readable and usable, it does not look as visually appealing. This is documented as part of the future work. For more information on the testing, head over to the testing section.\n\n\nOverall, we can mark ourselves \"good\" for the UI work.\n\n\n\nFunctionality: Since we have achieved all the key functionalities and 40% of the optional functionalities, the app can be seen as providing a lot functionality. We have made sure to use a generic system design so other universities can deploy scripts to setup the web application for their own use. Students can view twitter, twitch, find links within their university, look for resources on Linkedin Learning, look for resources within MS Learn, communicate with a QnA bot for queries, report their stress levels, get additional help on their studies or modules and change their preferences from the settings page. Most importantly students can also register for their lectures (this applies to our UCL client only for which a backend is being developed by the ORCA team).\n\n\nOverall, we give ourselves \"very good\" for functionality completion\n\n\n\nStability: Our team has done a lot of testing, having written more than 50 quality tests for unit and integration testing. We were sadly unable generate a coverage report due to the version of React we were using (one higher than the one the coverage report allows). The tests do not only include the web application, the tests also include MS Flows testing (which was manual) which is key part of our system to automate data to SharePoint to be used by lecturers and course representatives. During user acceptance testing, the flows had run successfully, as mentioned on the testing page. Even though we have not performed proper stress testing on the MS Flows, due to the lack of devices, testers and time, Microsoft has stated that all the flows we have created can have a 1000 concurrent runs within a minute.\nWe also have continuous integration setup within our github repository which is a formatter and linter ensuring the code written is to a good quality and standard.\n\n\nOverall, we give ourselves \"good\" for the stability section.\n\n\n\nEfficiency: Throughout the entire project we aimed to maximise performance. To do this, we used React as its been made to minimize costly DOM operations that in turn update the UI. In this case, not much extra work was needed to maximise the performance of the UI. However, even though the application loads up quickly and performs the basic operations well, in some cases it is slow. For example, when using the Linkedin Learning API to search for results, users have to wait for upto 8 seconds to receive UI feedback. We recognise that it is not the fault of our application as it is in fact the API that sends the results slowly. Overall, we have kept in mind that ultimately students will not have time to wait too much and ensured that majority of the UI loads in quickly.\n\n\nOverall, in this section we give ourselves \"good\".\n\n\n\nCompatibility: Ever since the project started we made sure to keep the devices and system the end-user would have. In this case, devices and systems would range from different browsers (chrome,firefox etc.) to different device types (tablets, mobile phones and laptops). We have conducted appropriate responsive testing and compatibility testing with different browsers and are proud to say that it works successfully on all browsers and screen sizes. However, user acceptance suggested that even though the UI for the laptop version was neat, it strayed from a \"standard\" design for larger screens which normally involved having a navigation bar at the top.\n\n\nIn this area, we give ourselves \"good\" in terms of responsive design.\n\n\n\nMaintainability: The code base is well documented via integration/unit tests (\"tests as documentation\") allowing developers to easily follow the codebase and extend upon it as necessary. Due to our component based design, the architecture can easily be changed without the code breaking. We have created essentially a component-based functionality but it is not fully extensible as it would require whats called \"shotgun surgery\". This means in order to add one component many different classes would need to be changed to facilitate that. Due to our lack of time we were unable to make this as a base architecture, and hence have written about this in future works.\n\n\nAs the code is well-documented via appropriate tests, we can give ourselves \"very good\" here.\n\n\n\nProject Management: This was difficult to do as one of our team members was an international student so communication and synchronisation was difficult. However, we made sure to set up meetings 24 hours prior to meeting them. Additionally, in the 2nd term we took a sprint based approach to the project where we would have regular stand-ups during the week at 10:30am. Github issue tracker was consistently used with the sprint boards to assign tasks to each member (as well as self assign). We could have potentially used Notion for the project instead which is deemed by many to be better and easier to use.\n\n\nIn this area, we give ourselves \"good\" because even though we completed the project with changing requirements, one of the members failed to communicate well-enough.\n\n\n\n\nFuture Work\n\nIf we had more time the following things is what would be appropriate to look into:\n\nThe first thing that should be done is that there should be a redesign of the user interface for the desktop version of the site. Even though the website scales well into a desktop version,\nit deviates from how a standard desktop site looks. However, the user interface looks good on tablet and mobile devices.\nA native version of the web application should be made. Since the app already exists as a React application, it would be appropriate to make a corresponding mobile application in React Native. This will probably improve the experience of the user as well.\nThe architecture of the web application can be redesigned so that it is extensible, currently the system does allow extensibility but requires modification of a fair number of parts of the application. So a redesign of the base of the system to instead use \"extends\" from a single App component to add more components would make the system significantly neater.\nConsidering universities want to learn on student stresses and wellbeing, data collected from the application can be mined via machine learning in terms of their wants and needs. Our system currently just stores this data and displays it.\n\n","id":"/evaluation/","title":"Evaluation"},"/home/":{"body":"Project Abstract\nProject Title: UCL CS Help and Insights Project in collaboration with Microsoft\nProblem Statement:\n\nWithin a university environment, student engagement and wellbeing is the key for success.\nHowever, it can be the case that current systems lack the ability to manage student engagement.\nWe are working with UCL for this project in conjunction with Microsoft to develop a web\napplication that assists in data collection for what students like and need. \nIt can be a series of micro apps or component functionality that can extend the app interface.\nIt will have a web portal as well as a cross platform mobile and app implementation. The system needs to be generic enough to work for several universities. A native approach for the cross-platform is not required, it should be responsive enough to adapt.\nYour solution:\n\nOur solution is a web application that allows students to access resources through Microsoft Learn and Linkedin Learning as well as a QnA chatbot. Additionally, students can get the latest news\nabout university via the twitter feed we have displayed. Additionally, students can register for their lectures via our web app (this only applies to UCL as a backend for this is being designed by a team called ORCA). Students can fill out forms to report their stress levels on their course anonymously. Course representatives and staff members can use this data to improve the experience for the students in that particular course. Students can also fill a form to request additional help with a topic or resource that may not directly be available on MS Learn/Linkedin Learning. This utilises a ticketing based system where all the forms data is automated to Sharepoint and displayed as a dashboard. \nAchievement and Impact:\n\nOur achievement would be students being able to receive the help and support they need. It also positively impacts course scores for student satisfaction as their needs and wants are being met by the university. Both MS Learn and Linkedin Learning have a built-in reporting mechanism so if students use these resources, universities can directly monitor this data. Our application makes the availability of these free resources for students transparent via our Student Help page, thus increasing their usage and helping them with educational support. Our client, Dean and UCL, are pleased with what we have achieved here.\n2 minute video\n\n    \n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n   \nThe development team\nThe development team is composed of three people: Hemil Shah, Pritika Shah and Louis de Wardt.\nHemil Shah\n\n\nhemil.shah.19@ucl.ac.uk\nFront-end developer, Website Editor, Researcher\nNot a great web developer but helped make the front-end\n\n  https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemil-shah-58747b161/\n\n\n\nLouis de Wardt\n\n\n\ncontact@louis.dewardt.uk\nFront &amp; back end developer, Researcher\n\n  https://github.com/louisdewar/\n\n\n\n\nPritika Shah\n\n\n\npritika.shah.19@ucl.ac.uk\nFront end developer, Tester \n\n  https://github.com/pritsspritss\n\n\n\n\nProject Management\nTerm 1\n\nTerm 2\n\nWebsite Template from: https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog.\n","id":"/home/","title":"Home"},"/implementation/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis page explains the implementation of our system, for reasoning behind the choice of frameworks see our research page.\nFront End\nThe front end is a react js app using a browser router to simulate the different pages. It also uses redux js for state management.\nThe src folder has four subdirectories worthy of mention:\n\npages: where the code for all the individual routable pages goes e.g. /Register or /Login.\ncomponents: individual components that may be shared across multiple pages.\ncommon: configuration values and thin wrappers around api calls.\nstate: code that handles state management with redux.\n\nDeployment\nApp &amp; Deploy config\nBefore the deployment can begin admins need to provide and app config, an example one is given in the root of the repository.\nDuring the deployment the app config is merged with some generated outputs from the deployment to produce a deploy config. Both the front and back ends get a deploy config file automatically generated during a deploy. This file will is in the .gitignore file and not be put into the git history. This is because it may contain sensitive or deployment specific information. This is useful for end users but may be cause difficulty with development. This is why for the client side there is devDeployConfig.json file so that the developers can provide all team members with a consistent environment. This file is automatically loaded if the front end detects it is running in \"development\" mode (essentially if the app is run via npm start instead of npm run build).\nTerraform\nThe development team can edit the file terraform/configuration.tf which describes the state of the deployment and gives Terraform all the information it needs to update the deployment. If we update the app and require new resources Terraform can keep track of the deployed state and update changes in place where possible.\nDeploy script\nThere is a file called deploy.py in the root of the project. The script is designed to be as helpful as possible for people who aren't technically experienced. Before anything begins the script checks for dependencies and common errors such as missing programs or forgetting to login using az login. If any of these errors are detected then the program will exit with helpful error messages.\nIt first runs Terraform and then merges the provided app config to produce the deploy configs. It will then npm install all the require packages for both the server and client. For the client it then builds the static react app and uploads it to the server and for the server it just uploads the source files directly.\nFeature Implementation\nSSO Login\nOur login system is entirely through Microsoft SSO allowing users to use their university accounts. This has a number of benefits including reducing the need for us to store user account details. We implement this using a redirect flow which we found works better than popups on many devices including mobiles. The system redirects the user to Microsoft's website where the user is prompted to log in. Once they have the user is redirected back to our app along with their access token. We then store this access token is our redux state which allows us to query the API on behalf of them. This token is also required by all of our endpoints to verify the identity of the user.\nTwo factor Authentication (2FA) and Registration\nWhen users register for lectures they must authenticate that it's actually them using a 2FA code. Before the user can register they must first setup their 2FA. When the user requests to set it up our app calls an Azure function endpoint which generates a new 2FA secret and then stores a record in the database (an Azure Cosmos DB) with the user ID but it marks the record with \"has_verified\" set to false. This is because the user isn't allow to reset their 2FA (for security as it would defeat the purpose of 2FA) but we don't want to lock it in until the user has verified that they've stored the secret. This is why we ask the user to enter the code once before it's marked as verified. Once this code is entered successfully the user is then able to use the code the register for classes. This is achieved by passing along the registration event to ORCA.\nThe algorithm for 2FA is TOTP which allows a shared secret to generate 6 digit numbers that are only valid for 30 second periods.\nSettings and Customisation\nWe store user settings as a JSON string inside an Azure Cosmos DB. Each JSON string is associated with a user ID which uniquely identifies the user. When the user loads a page which is customised by settings the app will call our Azure function endpoint to request the user settings. By default many setting values will be null/undefined  which is why we automatically fill in these values with a list of defaults. Since it takes some time to download the settings our app for a short amount of time uses these defaults until the real settings can be used.\nThe Settings page is the only place where users can edit these values. Whenever the user makes a change the system queues an update event and as long as the user doesn't edit any more settings within the next 400ms the system will upload the new settings (using an Azure function endpoint). This 400ms period is used to avoid making too frequent updates reducing server costs. The logic is that 400ms is a short amount of time to wait to apply the settings but long enough that if users are typing text into a field we won't generate an unreasonable amount of unnecessary network requests.\nThe actual application of the settings is dependent on the component that is using them. It may involve change CSS variables, optionally rendering various components and others. The settings system is designed to be very generic so that future improvements can add customisation without server side changes.\nForms and Well-being page\nThis page is relatively simple as it only shows some links to forms and their descriptions. The actual content (both the links and descriptions) is entirely generates from the app_config.yaml file to allows admins to show whatever they want to the users.\nInformation page\nOn our information page we directly integrate with several APIs including Microsoft Learn, Linkedin Learning and QnA Bot.\nThe Microsoft Learn and Linkedin Learning tabs both have similar flows which is to allow the user to search for something they need help with and then find direct links to the particular service to allow the user to participate in the course. With Microsoft Learn there is no search API so we have to download the entire catalogue of courses and then search through it locally. We cache the download to avoid extensive network usage. Linkedin Learning provides a search API but for security reasons we don't give access to the tokens that can be used to directly query the API to the client. Instead we provide an Azure function endpoint that acts as a proxy between Linkedin Learning and our app. This proxy also implements automatically refreshing the token whenever it expires.\nWhen our app is deployed the user provides a QnA Bot token which allows us to interact with that API to provide the user with a chat application where they can ask common questions to the bot.\nSharePoint site\nThe SharePoint site creation was a no-code solution. It requires you to select what lists and reports to display on the SharePoint site as shown below:\n\n\n\nAgain, the creation of the Sharepoint lists was also a no-code solution. You provide it with the columns you need and it will automatically generate these lists. Below is how the lists can be created:\n\n\n\nFinally, the creation of the pie charts and reporting system shown below was created through PowerBi:\n\n\n\nJust to show simply how we used PowerBi, here is a screenshot to show how you can select which charts to show and what data to use within those charts:\n\nTo include the above view into our SharePoint site, we would very simply need the reportID of the report that we created in PowerBi and hand it over to the SharePoint site which can then display the charts/analytics.\nCreation of the QnA Bot\nThe bot was created by following the steps below:\n\nCreated a QnAMaker resource within Azure\nUsed that resource to generate a QnA knowledgebase on the site (www.qnamaker.ai)\nThen once that is setup, use the Web Bot tool in Azure to create the QnA bot itself connected to the knowledgebase as shown by the image below:\n\n\nThe token would need to be obtained from the Bot resource to connect it to the front end (the web application we made).\n\nMore details of the above can be found in the deployment manual for SharePoint where a video guide is available on exactly how to make your own one.\nHow the flows work and were created\nTo generalise the implementation of all the data automation system, we made use of Microsoft Flows. To find reasoning on to why we used this, please check the research section of the website.\nImplementation of the flow that automates student additional help data to SharePoint lists\n\n\nAbove is the flow that allows the student help form data to be automated to the Sharepoint site. It looks very simple on the surface but there's a lot going on under the hood. Below I have provided a screenshot of the expanded condition part of the flow:\n\nEven though this uses no code, it can be read like code. So firstly, we check here which term the form is for. This data again comes from the form which the student fills out. Depending on the input of the term, it will automatically send it to the appropriate term list as you can notice under the conditional. If it is in term 1, it will default to the yes side of the branch and store the data in the Term 1 Responses list within SharePoint. If it is Term 2 or Term 3, which would go under the no condition in the first conditional statement, then it would store the data in those appropriate lists. Within create item, you can specify exactly what form data is stored under which column in the list.\n\n\nThis is the email part expanded. Over here, we get the student email details via the MS Form and we can specify the format of the automated email that is sent to the student in order to tell them that their request has been acknowledged.\nImplementation of the flow that automates data from student stress level form to Sharepoint list\n\n\nThe above flow is what allows the student stress level forms data to be automated to the Sharepoint list. Generally, MS Flows always start off with a trigger, in the current case it would be a stress level form being submitted. After this, we get the data of the form thats been submitted and fill out the column values in Sharepoint list using this data. One key thing to note here is that since the Stress Level column is an integer, you have to convert (typecast) the incoming Stress Level data from the form to an integer in order to store it in the Sharepoint list.\nImplementation of the flow that automates data from the student stress level form to PowerBi to setup reporting\n\n\nThe above flow is connected to a PowerBi streaming dataset, that has the fields of Course Code, Stress Level, Course Blockers and Timestamp. Then, we get the stress level data stored within the Sharepoint list and direct it towards PowerBi. The advantage of using this approach is that when we do setup a reporting system for this stress level data, it will not need to be refreshed.\nImplementation of the flow that allows pairings to be added and modified in the QnA knowledgebase\n\n\nThe above flow consists of many parts. So at the start we initialise some variables. The subscription key, kbID and endpoint variables are all related to the azure resource. These details are necessary to perform the API call that will update the knowledgebase. Below I have expanded the conditional part of the flow:\n\nFirstly, in the yes branch we have a updateItem HTTP call, what this means is that we are calling the endpoint for the knowledgebase in order to perform an update. The conditional checks whether its a new item or modified item in the Sharepoint List. If it is a modified value, we would default to the yes of this branch. Below I have further expanded the updateItem HTTP call:\n\n\n\nClearly, in this HTTP call, we need to perform a PATCH request to the API, with the body show in the image. The body specifies essentially which QnA pair to update (this uses the qnaId stored in the Sharepoint list) and the question/answer updates. Since we have called the API to perform an update, it returns a operationID in the body of the response. We use this response to perform a \"Do until\" (which you will notice in the image above the one above) which checks, by again calling the API, when is the knowledgebase ready to be published. Once its ready, it calls the publish knowledgebase endpoint which can be seen below:\n\n\n\nNow to focus on the NO of the initial branch which is if there is a new QnA pairing in the SharePoint list.\n\n\n\nIn the image above, you will notice another API call which has a separate body to if a QnA is modified. In this case what we are doing is providing some metadata to the values we are storing, in this case we use the ListID of the record from the SharePoint list. Title and Answer in the API call represent the Question and Answer pairing.\n\n\n\nIn the image above, you will notice that some of these are similar to the YES branch of the system, specifically the Do until and set variable tasks. Similarly to earlier, this just performs a check to see when is the knowledgebase ready to be published, then publishes it. We have to add here a manual delay of 30 seconds as we do not know when it is done with publishing the knowledgebase. After that, we download the knowledgebase and parse its data. To simplify the last few steps in the flow without further confusion, the aim of this last portion is to extract the qnaID of the question and answer pair that we just stored from the knowledgebase and add that value to the Sharepoint list (stored as a value under the column name of qnaId). This will be useful later in case the item is modified. If you noticed, in the YES branch, we provide the qnaID to the API so it knows which QnA pair is in fact being modified.\nImplementation of the flow that allows deletion of QnA pairs from the knowledgebase\n\n\nThe above flow consists again of many parts. Just like before, the subscription key, kbID and endpoint variables are things that will need to be provided by the one deploying our system for this part to work properly. The key parts of this flow is that we first need to download the entire knowledgebase, then after we need to extract all the QnA pairs that came from our Sharepoint List. This is easy because we filter the pairs with the metadata containing \"SPO\". If you noticed in the API calls from the previous flow, we added a \"SPO\" into the metadata for the QnA pairs as well as the Sharepoint ItemID.\n\n\n\nI have expanded the \"Apply to each SPO Question\" here. So once we get the data relating to just \"SPO\" we would loop through this and then do the following:\n\n\n\nThen what we need to do is compare the metadata value, Sharepoint ItemID, of the QnA pair with the Sharepoint ItemID of the Sharepoint list item that has just been deleted. If we do find it, we would trigger the yes branch and delete the item from the knowledgebase. Similarly as before, it would be a API call to the knowledgebase that would look like below:\n\n\n\nClearly, all we need to provide is the qnaId of the item we want to delete once it is matched. The qnaId can be directly obtained from the metadata of the QnA pair list item. After that we perform a \"Do until\" like before where we query the knowledgebase endpoint on whether or not the deletion is finished. Once finished, we would publish the knowledgebase for production use.\n","id":"/implementation/","title":"Implementation"},"/requirements/":{"body":"Intro to Project Background and Clients\nCurrently, students do not have any simple ways of conveying their wants and needs to staff members at \nuniversities. Additionally, staff have no easy way of collecting data and categorising them in order to see\nwhat students really enjoy about their lectures. Our client was UCL, a world-renowned university in the heart of\nLondon. They currently have an exisiting system that provides data based on submissions on a system known as Moodle\nbut it lacks suitable measures for student feedback and engagement.\nProject Goals\nOur project goal is to increase student engagement with staff members and allow staff at UCL to easily monitor how their students\nare doing in relation to their courses. In technical terms, our project is oriented around developing a responsive web\napplication that serves students and stores data about what they need in terms of resources for staff to see. The application should also\nprovide appropriate help to students in terms of resources. \nClient Requirements\nAn online meeting was arranged via Microsoft Teams with our clients.\nDuring the meeting, we received our list of requirements which consisted of things that must be implemented and some extras which\ncan be implemented depending on our timeframe. Initially, multiple meetings were conducted in order to produce a clear MoSCoW and remove\nany ambiguities. Below are example questions that we asked the clients:\n\nWhat type of application are we developing (desktop or mobile)?\nIs there any example applications that already exist?\nIs there a particular endpoint or server this application should work with? (Sharepoint e.g.)\n\nPersonas\n\n\nScenarios\nJon Brown\nJon is a CS student who is currently in 2nd year. He has a strong interest in quantum computing. He knows that his university has research currently ongoing in that area and he is unaware of whom to contact. He decided to use our web application to get further insight in this matter. He found it easy to navigate through the web application which contained a search form to ask him what topic area he is looking for. He found the hierarchical system informative and easy to understand. Using the same system he was able to find which staff member to approach to fix his license key issues. Every week he is further prompted by the system to give feedback on his current lectures, so the course can be improved towards his liking (i.e. help increase his course satisfaction).\nEva Smith\nEva Smith is a CS lecturer who is currently researching quantum computing. She knows that students are somewhat engaged via the use of an online system called Moodle. She wants to know which students are regularly attending their online lectures and she does not want to waste time with a conventional register during the online lecture. Therefore, she uses our web application to give a code to everyone who is attending, which would be then used by the students to confirm their attendance via our web application. Additionally, she wants feedback on how well she is performing in her lectures. The system contacts students via a chatbot weekly to get feedback. The system generates a word cloud using sentiment analysis and presents it to the lecturer. \nUse Case list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n  Use Case\n  \n \n \n  \n  ID\n  \n  \n  UCA1\n  \n

However, if we segment the parts of the web application,\nthen there are many existing solutions to build parts of our application with as opposed to the entire system. Below is an outline of what we looked into,\nfurther analysis of this is available further down.\nLogin\nFirstly, we have to build a login system for students, who can login via university details. The options for this include using Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Service) and setup our application through there, alternatively we can use UCL API which is developed by students at UCL. Again the main features of this is a call to the respective APIs in order to gain access tokens so the user can be validated through their service. The advantage for us is that it saves us the effort of setting up a separate database for the login system. What we can learn from this is that there is ready-made code for authentication and it will need to be changed according to the context of the application.\nRegistration for classes with 2FA\nSecondly, we need to setup a 2FA (two factor authentication system) for the online class register. There are a number of articles that describe how to add this to our web app generically. We need to make sure its using Microsoft systems hence the following is suitable for example: Two Factor Authentication Article. This is only one example of the articles we have found that describe how to implement the system. The main feature of this is how the actual two factor authentication works in client and server side. For example, it uses Twilio to authenticate the user by sending an SMS message to them. We made some rough calculations and determined at the scale of UCL that SMS would be far too expensive to do many times a day for each user. Instead we will support TOTP and allow the user to use an application of their choice to store the token.\nEven though this article is for Python Django and PHP it is useful to understand how two factor authentication works under the hood. What we can learn is after the user has signed in we need to add another security layer, in the case of this article, describes a time based token which is generated dynamically based on time and the users secret. This secret would need to be generated by our code and then stored in a database safely.\nStoring data in Sharepoint\nThen the question comes to how do we store data within Sharepoint, which is in fact a completely different framework to everything. This is the only documentation we needed: Sharepoint Link It contained all the necessary information to setup a Sharepoint site as well as get it to store data. So the key features in this are that a Sharepoint site would need to be firstly created, then a Sharepoint list needs to be created, which is essentially what stores the data, and finally to create the dashboard view these objects would need to be displayed to the site page. This was not enough however, as to get data to Sharepoint\nwe needed to gain access to the site itself. We had 2 options for Sharepoint, one was to allow our app access to all of Sharepoint (Microsoft does not allow the app access to only one site) and the other was a Microsoft Flow that automates data from a Microsoft Form to Sharepoint. Microsoft Flow is a process and task automation tool that helps connect different applications and services together. Many of these applications that can be used with Flow are cloud-based, although it is also possible to use Flow in an on-premises environment1. What we can learn using this existing system, is that it is quite easy to automate data to Sharepoint so when we go on to build our app, which will include students filling out forms, it will be appropriate for it to be a Microsoft Form and then the forms data gets sent to a Sharepoint list via the Flow.\nSingle Sign On\nOur team wrote an article about implementing single sign on (SSO) and it can be found \nhere\n.\nDevice Support\nThis web app should support all device types, it's made for students hence compatibility between all devices is necessary.\nDetailed Research\nThis section is divided into parts describing programming language, frameworks, libraries, APIs and extras that we have researched for this project. Comparisons have also been made where appropriate (where we allowed flexibility of choice).\nSingle Page App vs Multi Page App\nThe first task was to pick an appropriate language/framework to produce our system in. We had 2 options, one was to use a standard HTML,CSS,JS system and the other was to design a single page application using React. There was a few things to consider in terms of non functional requirements which we would need to take into account.\nBelow is a comparison of React and traditional multi-page apps:\nAdvantages of Single Page Apps over Multi Page Apps:\n\nSince SPAs render themselves, the user only needs to download the code once and then from then on the app can be populated with small specific API calls whereas MPAs must render new full HTML pages each time meaning there is more redundant data being sent.\nWith particular relation to this project, another advantage is that it makes it significantly easier to develop a mobile application because a lot of the backend code for webapp and native app is common. For example React and React Native. Components can be interchangeably used between them according to how well defined they are.\nThis is important because our aim is to make a responsive app, so this allows us to first create a full blown system in React for desktop then easily integrate this with React Native.\nAdditionally, code to render pages on a server is not needed. Deployment is incredible simple as it's just about hosting some static files.\n\nDisadvantages of Single Page Apps over Multi Page Apps:\n\nA key disadvantage with SPAs is that they require JavaScript which is not always enabled on the client's browser. Additionally the use of JavaScript opens up the possibility of a cross site scripting (XXS) attack in case we rely on a dependency which an attacker has gained control over.\nMPAs scale significantly better than SPAs. Since MPAs can have as many pages as required, more products/services can be added easily.\nSince logic is moved out of the server and to the client side, the client would get access to functions they should not have. Therefore, if we do follow this approach, we will have to be careful about ensuring proper access control to prevent leaking of data2.\n\nConclusion of SPA vs MPA\nConclusively, we have decided to go ahead with a single page app. Firstly, single page apps load faster meaning it would be convenient for users. Switching to a MPA does not mitigate XSS concerns since it is still common to use JavaScript with external dependencies there, it's just that SPA necessitate JavaScript. Furthermore as long as we are careful to limit our dependencies to a few trustworthy packages we shouldn't have too many issues. \nWhich JavaScript framework to use for SPA?\nThere a few main frameworks/libraries to consider here in terms of what to pick:\n\n\nReact: It is a front-end library that is used for creating user interfaces. It renders its own DOM in the browser meaning its performance is better. Less code needs to be written to do the same amount of work as other frameworks3. Code is split into components which makes it reusable. It is also relatively stable, having gained adoption with many major companies all with a vested interest in keeping react working4.\n\n\nReact can also work with react native which helps in easier development of mobile applications meaning it would be better for further future development of this app.\n\n\nNode: It is a lightweight server side library. This library is much better to read large streams of data. Node is also highly extensible due to the existing package modules.\nAdditionally, Node executes outside the browser.5 'It’s a lightweight and efficient JavaScript runtime environment on the server side, powered by the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, that uses a non-blocking I/O model' 2.\n\n\nAngular: Components are known as directives. These represent DOM elements that add behaviour once Angular finds them. HTML elements are broken down as component parts and behaves as JavaScript code, making it different to both React and Vue6.\n\n\nConclusion of JS Framework to use:\nWith regards to the information above, we have decided to go ahead with React. Firstly, it is the fastest according to the chart above in server side rendering. Secondly, it is fairly easy to pickup as well according to many sources meaning it is appropriate to use this since 2/3 members have never done web development and we only have around 11 weeks for this project.\nThe requirements are also biased towards front-end development and a few api calls to MS Graphs to produce the required functionalities of the application meaning React would be suitable here.\nThe most important reason is that we can easily incorporate the backend code and some of the front end logic for making a native application for Android and Apple. In our first prototype we plan on making a responsive web-app and then move that to react native during the 2nd prototype stage.\nDeployment\nOur client believes our app has potential beyond UCL and he also wants the app to be easily redeploy-able by people without much technical expertise. This presents a somewhat difficult challenge since we are Azure native (our application is running entirely through Azure cloud services) we need to deploy many resources in an automated manner. We also need a configuration file that administrators can edit which will then be reflected in the deployed version of the app.\nWe spent a significant amount of time researching into Terraform but during development we usually manually ran the commands for the final stages and we eventually converted that manual process into the python script.\nTerraform\nTerraform is a program that lets you declare the exact state of the deployed cloud resources and it can then query the Azure API to deploy them. If we ever change the configuration Terraform can handle the incremental updates without destroying and redeploying the resources. There are two providers for Terraform that are designed for deploying Azure resources azurerm and azuread.\nWe also experimented with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates but they have relatively limited functionality and are difficult to automate so further details on this have been omitted.\nPython Script\nAlthough Terraform is great it can't deploy the actual code, only the \"slots\" where the code can go. Further more we need to customise variables within both the client and server side code some of which can only be known after deployment. This is why we have to deploy Terraform and then upload the server and client code.\nTechnologies we want to use:\nAPI(s) we researched:\nThe main API we have researched is MS Graphs API as this was really what constituted the requirements. We can make appropriate calls to Graphs which contains user information\nin order to make a personalised experience for them. This exposes a REST API to access data from MS Cloud services. For example, we can use this to develop the engagement section\nwhere we can add a part that gets data from a students calendar and display what events they are signed upto or need to attend. Below is a link to the Graphs API:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview.\nOur partner introduced us to the graph explorer which lets us make example API calls to Graphs to see examples of responses we would get. \nThis is particularly useful to ensure you make the right API call to the right resource. Since this app is supposed to be generic, we can define a generic API call to MS Graphs\nand the only thing we would need during deployment is an authentication token from Azure Active Directory.\nAgain a link to this is here:\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=me&amp;version=v1.0.\n\nAnother important API was the Microsoft Learn API. This was a simple catalogue which contains the details, in a JSON format, of all the modules and learning pathways that Microsoft provided.\nThis was useful as our application would make a API call to retrieve this data and present it to the user in the case where they require assistance in a particular topic. In order to complete\nthe module, students must head over to the actual website which our app would link to. Details regarding the MS Learn API is detailed below:\nLink to MS Learn Catalog.\nThe response body of calling this API would look as follows:\n{\n  \"modules\": [ ... ],\n  \"learningPaths\": [ ... ],\n  \"products\": [ ... ],\n  \"roles\": [ ... ],\n  \"levels\": [ ... ]\n}\n\nWe are particularly interested in just modules and learning paths so the appropriate courses according to the user input can be extracted from there.\n\nA final API that we have researched is LinkedIn Learning. Since UCL already provides free licenses for this to students, its a free resource that our application could surface. Currently, there is not existing code that uses that API. To use the API, we need to provide a client key and secret which we must obtain from the teaching and learning team at UCL. After receiving this, we would need to generate a token (or our app would have to do it during runtime) which would be used in combination with the students search in order to generate a result. A detailed explanation can be found on this link: Link to Linkedin Learning API. This provides a thorough breakdown on how to use the API to make calls and get the data. We would very simply need to make a GET request as below:\nGET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/{service}/{resourceIdentifier}\n\nIn here we specify the service and resource that we want. For example, we can tell the API to specifically return videos, modules or learning pathways. Unlike MS Learn we cannot cache the data directly into the application as it would not only be too large but impossible. Additionally, due to the way the API works, there would be a fair delay before students would get their search results compared to MS Learn. Below is a sample response of calling the API:\n{\n    \"urn\": \"urn:li:lyndaCourse:563322\",\n    \"title\": {\n        \"locale\": {\n            \"country\": \"US\",\n            \"language\": \"en\"\n        },\n        \"value\": \"Measuring Company Culture\"\n    }\n}\n\nThe response can be filtered in the Linkedin Learning API for the following things:\n\nAvailability - The availibility of the learning asset\navailableLocales - \tThe locales the learning asset is available in.\nclassifications - The learning classifications the learning asset is tagged with.\ndescription - If present, the text-only description of the learning asset, localized if available. Any HTML markup will be stripped from this description.\nurls - The URLs that can be used to launch the learning asset.\n\nDue to the number of fields, we have omitted the remaining values but if you would like to know about them please check this link: Response Fields\n\nThe research for the QnABot was not too difficult as our technology partner shared with us a simple way to set one up through Azure. If more details are required please check this link: QnABot. Essentially, we would need to setup a few resources including a QnAMaker resource and a web app bot that is connected to a knowledgebase. Then in order to actually update the knowledgebase we would need to find appropriate API calls to add QnA pairings to the knowledgebase. We then found this link: API for QnABot. This API lets us update the knowledgebase of the QnABot but we would need to provide certain parameters. These included the knowledgebase ID, the endpoint and the subscription key. All these can be found from the resources we create in Azure. Very simply, we would need to make a POST request to the QnA API, providing the above things as well as the QnA pair we would like to add. Then, we would need to check whether or not the knowledgebase is ready to be published. Note: Adding a QnA pair does not automatically publish it for production. The adding only performs the training for the bot in the knowledgebase. The publishing of the knowledgebase to the live version would have to be done by another API call. This would be a POST request to the same API but different request URL. This is useful because Microsoft Flows has the power to perform HTTP requests meaning we can setup the flows to perform these API calls directly from a SharePoint list that contains these QnA pairings.\n\nThe APIs we have researched have been quite limited as our client, Dean, was very specific with what he wanted and so our research in the API section is short.\nSummary\nTo summarise, we have decided to go ahead with a Single Page application, particularly React, for the front end development of our web application. \nThis is because React has a React Native version so in the future a mobile application can be developed more easily. Additionally, the backend store would be a Azure Cosmos DB\nin order to store user settings and preferences. The storage of user requests (ticketing system) like things they need help in would be a Sharepoint site, so staff can view it and directly respond to the student which was in fact a direct requirement of our client. This automation of data to the Sharepoint list would be facilitated by a Microsoft Flow. Also, we have decided to use the Microsoft Graph API as it is the only appropriate API available to make the application more native for the user (for example retrieve\ndata like their name, meetings etc.). We have also decided to go ahead with using the Microsoft Learn API and Linkedin Learning API to get courses because it would be readily available to students since universities which use Microsoft services are naturally given access to it. We have also decided to make use of the QnABot directly from Azure as it would be a simple bot setup and easily applicable for any university.\nFootnotes and References\n\n\n4: \nhttps://www.droptica.com/blog/9-companies-use-react/\n\n\n\n1: \nhttps://www.contentformula.com/blog/what-is-microsoft-flow-and-how-can-i-use-it\n\n\n\n2: \nhttps://rubygarage.org/blog/single-page-app-vs-multi-page-app\n\n\n\n3: \nhttps://medium.com/@OPTASY.com/react-js-vs-node-js-what-are-the-main-differences-which-one-to-choose-for-your-next-web-app-7b07e344e4fb\n\n\n\n7: \nhttps://www.esparkinfo.com/angular-vs-node-vs-react.html\n\n\n\n5: \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/56383144/reactjs-vs-nodejs-why-do-i-need-to-create-both\n\n\n\n6: \nhttps://www.codeinwp.com/blog/angular-vs-vue-vs-react\n\n\n\n8: \nhttps://hackernoon.com/server-side-rendering-shootout-with-marko-preact-rax-react-and-vue-25e1ae17800f\n\n\n\n","id":"/research/","title":"Research"},"/sso-article/":{"body":"Project: UCL Resourcium\nTeam members: Louis de Wardt (\nhttps://github.com/louisdewar/\n), Hemil Shah (\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/hemil-shah-58747b161/\n), Pritika Shah (\nhttps://github.com/pritsspritss/\n)\nWith the complexities that come with setting up your own database to make a login system, the best alternative would be to use Microsoft live login instead. This works by “handing” over responsibilities of login management to Microsoft as well as security technicalities. Having to design your own database with login and passwords also slows the development process, giving you less time as developers to focus on things that you need. Our project aimed to allow an easy way for students to access our application and get assistance. The simplest answer was for students to use their existing login (also known as SSO ‘Single Sign On’) to access apps. This does not only simplify things for the developer, but also the user themselves since it reduces the need for them to remember another set of usernames and passwords. This article will explain in detail on how you can setup your application to use live login directly with Microsoft.\nThis is designed to work for single page apps, if your app involves a web server serving each page separately then you will need to use a slightly different login flow (specifically the Web flow rather than the Single-page application)\nSetting everything up\n\nYou need an app registration on Azure Active Directory. Go to Active Directory -&gt; App Registrations -&gt; New Registration. We chose SSO Example App  for the app name but you can choose your own app name. You need to decide for yourself whether your app should be single or multi-tenant. We can skip the redirect URL for now but we'll need to come back to that.\n\nThese screenshots describe this process visually:\n\nPress the new registration button:\n\n\n\n\nYou need a web based application with a button that can trigger the sign on event. An example of a simple one can be found at the end. This application also needs to be hosted on a URL. For development it is common to use localhost. For example react applications would be http://localhost:3000. If your application is composed of just static files then you'll need a local web server to host them. A simple way is to use the following command (assuming you have python installed) python3 -m http.server 3000 which will broadcast the current directory to your local computer on port 3000, you should be able to access your website at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.\n\n\nIn the app registration you need to add the URL of your app to the list of allowed redirect URLs. To do this go to Authentication -&gt; Add a Platform -&gt; Single-page application. Then enter the redirect URL and then press configure (leave all the other values as their defaults). When you publish your app you will also need to add the public URL of the app as another redirect URL.\n\n\nHere you can see screenshots showing each step:\n\nHere you should choose Single-page application:\n\nEnter in the redirect URL (such as http://localhost:3000)\n\nCode\n\n\nAdd the MSAL library for JavaScript as a dependency to your project. There are multiple ways of doing this. You can either run npm install @azure/msal-browser or use a CDN. This is documented officially here.\n\n\nYou need to copy the App ID and, if you are using single tenant, you also need the tenant ID. This information can be found in the Overview section of the App Registration.\n\n\nCreate a variable to store this information:\nvar msalConfig = {\n  auth: {\n    clientId: \"{{APP_ID}}\",\n    // Only required if single tenant (remove if multi-tenant)\n    authority:\n      \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{TENANT_ID}}\",\n  },\n};\n\n\nNow we can create a function to start the login process:\n\nfunction login() {\n  var msalInstance = new msal.PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);\n\n  msalInstance\n  // Here you can specify scopes (see example code for more details)\n    .loginPopup({})\n    .then((response) =&gt; {\n      if (response === null) {\n        showError(\"There was an error authenticating you (response was null)\");\n        return;\n      }\n\n      showResult(response);\n    })\n    .catch((error) =&gt; {\n      showError(\"There was an unexpected error during the login process\");\n      console.error(error);\n    });\n}\n\nHere we chose the popup method of authentication, you can also chose redirect.\nThe functions called showError and showResult are examples and they will likely be different in your application.\nThe response object has a field called accessToken which you can use to query data on behalf of the user.\nScopes\nBy default you are very limited by what you can do with the access token for security reasons. If you want to be able to perform more actions you can add scopes. Here is an example from the MSAL documentation:\nvar loginRequest = {\n    scopes: [\"user.read\", \"mail.send\"]\n};\n\nNow we can update the loginPopup parameters from earlier:\nmsalInstance\n    .loginPopup(loginRequest)\n    // ... the rest of the code\n\nNow the access token will have access to those scopes.\nNote: you will also need to update the permissions on the app registration for all scopes except for user.read which is on the registration by default.\nExample app\nAttached here is an example app that demonstrates using SSO login on a single page app without any frameworks (pure JavaScript).\nTo run you need to download the source code and host it locally such as by using python3 -m http.server 3000. You then need to create the app registration which will give you access to a tenant id and an app id. You should then edit the script.js file to update the clientId and authority (see the msalConfig variable). You need to set the single page app redirect URL to be localhost:3000 or your local URL.\nUseful links\n\n\n  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview\n\n\n\n\n\n  https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/README.md#prerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\n  https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/initialization.md\n\n\n\n\n\n  https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/login-user.md\n\n\n\n\n\n  https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/acquire-token.md\n\n\n\n","id":"/sso-article/","title":"Implementing SSO with Microsoft Accounts (for Single Page Apps)"},"/systemdesign/":{"body":"System architecture diagram\nThis diagram shows our overall architecture omitting some minor details:\n\nThe section introduces the design of the web application. In simple terms, our system uses a typical client-server based system but what makes it different is the idea of a server-less back end, which requires something known as azure functions to make the calls.\nThe view the user sees is all directly from the client-side. To simplify, when a user logs in, the view that is displayed is dependent upon their settings where this data is stored as Blob storage within Azure. Before these server-less calls can be made, users need to be authenticated via Microsoft and then they are redirected to their homepage.\nFor example, if the user has twitch and twitter enabled within their settings, then they will be able to view them both from the homepage. Again, this makes use\nof a server-less function which calls the Blob storage to retrieve this data.\nUser interactions are captured via the clicks which is used to eventually render the pages that they see. The main logic of the app with regards to rendering of the different pages is in the App.js file.\nSince we are using React, it is a single page application and all the pages are split into components which uses a \"Router\" to access these different pages/components hence there are no specific pages programmed in by the back end.\nUser changes with regards to settings is updated when the user saves their new settings to the database, which is directly used in certain pages to render the appropriate view.\nWhen the user wants to access resources, they can search via the application which essentially calls an API in order to retrieve data and display results according to the user search. The MS Learn API does not have a built-in filter for the resources it provides, hence the system has been setup to cache the data for session storage in order to minimise API calls.\nThe QnA bot is a simple embed which automatically handles user requests and responses internally/by itself. It uses a library provided by Microsoft called DirectLine Chat.\nWith regards to the forms section of the app, they are very simply links to Microsoft Forms that students fill out. The processing that happens after the form is submitted is independent of the app itself. What happens is a Microsoft Flow automates data to a Sharepoint list and PowerBi, this in turn produces real time streaming data in order to generate a dashboard to be viewed by staff in a Sharepoint site. This flow also triggers an email to the person who filled out the \"Additional Help\" form to acknowledge their request.\nClass Diagram\nOur system does not require a class diagram as it is a web application that does not utilise a class based design. Dr Yun Fu has confirmed that our team does not require a class diagram.\nEntity relationship diagram\nOur database is technically schemaless but we follow the pattern below:\n\nData Storage\nWe not only have the above database to store information. We also have a separate system, also known as a SharePoint list. Due to the way SharePoint lists work (not a traditional database) we have not created an ER diagram for that. If you are interested in viewing what exactly the SharePoint lists store, it is shown in the screenshot below:\n\nThe above screenshot represents a SharePoint list that can store 30 million values. We have three of the same lists setup, which instead have different names corresponding to each term. So one for term 1, another for term 2 and finally for term 3. The data stored in this list comes from the Additional Help Form that we designed.\n\n\n\nThe above screenshot is a SharePoint list that stores data for the Student Stress Levels form that we have created.\n\n\n\nThe above screenshot is a SharePoint list that stores and updates the QnA pairings. This list is connected to the knowledgebase of the QnA Bot and updates it in turn. For more information on this please check the implementation page for more details on this.\nSequence Diagram\nBelow is an example sequence diagram of one of our use cases of our system. This particularly covers a student coming into our web application in order to search for the resources. Out of all use cases, this would be the most complicated sequence diagram, if sequence diagrams for other use cases would be designed they would be very similar to the one shown below:\n\nSitemap Diagram\n\n","id":"/systemdesign/","title":"System Design"},"/testing/":{"body":"Testing Strategy\nOur project is a mixture of tools and code. For example, we use Microsoft Flows and SharePoint which would require manual testing whereas for the codebase, which refers to the actual web application itself, it was full of automated testing.\nTo simplify, we used the following test methods:\n\nUnit testing and Integration Testing\nPerformance Testing\nResponsive Testing\nCompatibility Testing\nUser Acceptance Testing\n\nUnit tests and integration tests have been applied where appropriate in the codebase, for example performing snapshot testing which automatically checks whether or not the page that we want is rendered correctly. Unit tests were used to test API calls to ensure that no error is produced when trying to get data from the API, since our system uses quite a few (namely Microsoft Graphs, Linkedin Learning and Microsoft Learn).\nIntegration and Unit Testing\nIntegration testing\nWe wrote integration tests and used the front-end testing tool 'Cypress' to find bugs in our application. Cypress allowed us to stimulate tests as if a user is operating on the web app with the ability to see screenshots for each step. Cypress allowed us to write a customised  'login' commands which made writing our tests easier.\nIn total, we wrote 8 integration tests aggregating to 42 test cases, testing the individual functionality as well as the User Interface of the app as a whole. \nIntegration tests\n\nTest cases for each Integration test\n\nThe different tests helped us find bugs for e.g. the microsoft learn search bar couldn't give search results for some of the test cases and then we solved those bugs for a better user experience.\nUnit Testing\nOur Integration tests helped test the specific pages within our application and even though they made up the bulk of the code they were some components that we could individually test using unit tests.\nWe used the jest framework to run our client side tests. This was built into react which made it very convenient. We focused on testing components that were separated from the actual pages (since the Cypress tests already covered those). This included the tabs and links sections but the most useful tests were our API tests.\nThese API tests allowed us to test both our server side back end and the functions we wrote on the client side to integrate with them. In writing these tests we discovered a bug in our local functions that we promptly fixed.\nWe used a mixture of assertions and snapshot testing. Snapshot testing is where you store a known \"good\" response from the functions and then update it manually if we update the app.\nHere you can see all the unit tests passing:\n\nPerformance Testing\nUsing Firefox developer tools we can see the time it takes for our application to query various endpoints:\nEndpointSample #1 (ms)Sample #2 (ms)Sample #3 (ms)Average (ms)\nInitial Load62222135\nGet settings271181254235\nUpdate settings203177196192\nSetup 2fa314192209238\nVerify 2fa218246213226\nRegister218175235209\nMicrosoft learn (cached)15101212\nLinkedin Learning2,0202,2302,0502100\n\nResponsive Testing\nIt was important to check how the user interface fits into different screen sizes like different mobiles, laptops and tablets so we did responsive testing through Google Chrome's Developer Tools.\nPhone view\n\nTablet view\n\nDesktop view\n\nThe responsive testing helped us design the user interface which adjusts to the size of the screen making it easy to use on all devices.\nCompatibility Testing\nTest with different browsers and devices (android + ios + windows)\nWe tested the compatibility of our web app using different browsers: Safari, Chrome and BROWSER.\nChrome\n\nSafari\n\nThe user interface was very intuitive and the links were a good feature.\nThe web app worked well with the popular browsers that we tested on and made us confident in its compatibility.\nUser Acceptance Testing\nWe wanted to check how actual users would respond to our application we shared the link where they could use the application on their own devices and handed out feedback forms to analyse their responses.\nSummary of the responses\n\nThe average response from the users has been very positive, making us confident in our development. An interesting suggestion was a tutorial for the first time a user log's in to help with navigation and understanding the application but we think the user manual would suffice for that.\nFeedback from client\nWe are pleased to say that our client, Dean and our project partner, Lee Stott (Microsoft) are satisfied with the application we have developed, considering its a first generational system.\nManual Testing for the SharePoint and Microsoft Flows\nSince this part of the system cannot be automated for testing, we performed manual testing. This involved us putting the Flow into the testing stage and manually submitting requests to it, in order to ensure the flows run. These manual tests below are necessary to ensure that data is successfully automated from one part of the system to another. It can be seen as a manual integration test to ensure that the entire flow (which is made up of components that cannot be tested individually) runs. The test tool we used for this would be the builtin test mechanism in Microsoft Flows, we have provided screenshots of this in each of the tests we have run and how exactly we ran each of the tests.\nBelow we have ran 5 manual tests to ensure each of the flows work:\nTest 1 - Test the flow which automates data from the Additional Help Form to the SharePoint List\n\n\nAt the beginning of testing the flow I would click on manual and then the test button. If you notice there is an automatic test option, however that would require some triggers setup that would automatically run these tests. Due to our trigger being a form being filled out, this cannot be automated since someone will have to fill out the form to actually test it.\nThe next step is to submit a form to check whether or not the flow successfully runs.\nIf the flow does run successfully then it will inform you that it has worked (emphasising the end of the test). Below is a screenshot of the test flow running correctly:\n\n\nTest 2 - Test the flow which automates data from the Student Stress Levels form to the SharePoint List\n\n\nAt the beginning of testing the flow I would click on manual and then the test button. This will put the flow in a testing state.\nThe next step is to submit the form to see whether or not the flow will run and successfully add the data to the SharePoint list.\nIf the flow does run successfully, then a positive response shows as shown below:\n\n\nTest 3 - Test the flow which automates data from Stress Levels List to PowerBi for reporting\n\n\nAt the beginning of testing the flow I would click on manual and then the test button. This will put the flow in a testing state. \nAlthough the trigger for this system is values being added to a SharePoint list, it is easier to do this through filling out a form which will in-turn run this flow.\nSince the flow ran successfully, the following response is produced:\n\n\nTest 4 - Test the flow which updates the QnA bot knowledgebase with new QnA pairings via a SharePoint list\n\n\nAt the beginning of testing the flow I would click on manual and then the test button. This will put the flow in a testing state. \nIn this case a trigger would be adding values to the SharePoint list containing the pairings. So in this case I would add a Question and Answer pair to the list and check whether or not\nthe flow runs successfully. After doing so I received the below message to confirm it works:\n\n\nTest 5 - Test the flow which deletes QnA pairings from the knowledgebase using the SharePoint list\n\n\nAt the beginning of testing the flow I would click on manual and then the test button. This will put the flow in a testing state.\nIn this case, the trigger of the flow is a deletion of a QnA pairing from the SharePoint list. Below is the result of attempting to delete the QnA I added in the test earlier (Test 4):\n\n\nConclusion of Manual Testing and MS Flows\nTo conclude with, the Flows testing has been successful as it runs well when attempting to perform the trigger actions that cause them to run. They also ran well during user acceptance testing when they filled out forms which triggers each of these flows. Below is an example screenshot of the flows running well during user acceptance testing:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the flows run just fine and take an extremely short period of time, relating to performance testing too. This emphasises that our system is scalable as well.\n","id":"/testing/","title":"Testing"},"/uidesign/":{"body":"Sketches\nAfter producing our MoSCoW list, we started the HCI section research for the interface. This was particularly important as the application\nwas for students and user experience would be the key target of this application apart from the data collection and insights. While designing the \ninterface we also made sure to keep contact with our client in order to keep them updated and keep the design focussed. To ensure a usable design,\nwe took the following goals in mind(1):\n\nAccessibility: Since this was a student based application, a responsive design would be very important as students may want to use the application on their phones\nas opposed to tablets. Mobile responsiveness within the web app would be very important (i.e. taking a mobile first approach and then upscaling the website from there).\nAvailability: Ensure that any forms for points of data collection or external links are not broken otherwise it would ruin the user experience\nClarity: It is necessary that students can do what they need to in this application. In this case they should be able to setup their two factor authentication and be able to \nregister themselves for their lecture (We only need to make the front end design for this where students need to get authenticated via a time based one time password, the backend\nwould be university specific and would break the point of easy deployment for our application). Under this follows consistency, meaning the design is quite unibody and easy to follow.\nSimplicity: As simple as this ones sounds, the design of the application should be straightforward (i.e. no clutter with a neat user interface).\n\nHere are the sketches we produced (they are not the most beautiful but wait till you see our high fidelity wireframe):\n\n\nNote: The sketches shown here are based on the initial requirements we were given, over the course of the year these changed and design changes/decisions were made. For example the second sketch has a staff login which was in fact removed later as application was limited to students. Hence the view for staff within this app has been omitted.\nHCI Interactive Prototype\nAfter many re-adjustments to the initial design and hours of thinking, we came up with a fresh design on the prototype which was loved by our client due to its clean design. We used Figma to create this prototype as it was easy to use. Here is our live prototype which may take a while to load in:\n\nSome things that are notably important is how drastically we changed our initial sketches to this UI Design. The reason in particular was easier navigation. What else you can notice is we have tried to make coupling between the application and UCL as minimum as possible. For example even though the load in screen uses the UCL logo, when universities deploy our application they will just need to replace that image with their own universities image. The Hi, Hemil that you may have noticed in the wireframe is pulled from MS Graphs (taking data directly from Microsoft Azure Active Directory) so once universities setup our application into their eco system, not much tweaking would be necessary.\nEvaluation of prototype:\nOur team sent this prototype to many users and asked them to comment on how our prototype was which was a form of informal feedback. Using this feedback we came up with the table below as our improvements to be made for the prototype to make it more usable:\n\nReferences\n\n(1) https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/principles-website-usability/\n\n","id":"/uidesign/","title":"UI Design"}},"docInfo":{"/":{"body":0,"title":0},"/appendices/":{"body":1681,"title":1},"/deployment/":{"body":368,"title":2},"/evaluation/":{"body":711,"title":1},"/home/":{"body":283,"title":1},"/implementation/":{"body":1468,"title":1},"/requirements/":{"body":1007,"title":1},"/research/":{"body":1686,"title":1},"/sso-article/":{"body":542,"title":7},"/systemdesign/":{"body":416,"title":2},"/testing/":{"body":814,"title":1},"/uidesign/":{"body":304,"title":2}},"length":12},"lang":"English"};
