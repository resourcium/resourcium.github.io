    <h2>Intro to Project Background and Clients</h2>
      <p>Currently, students do not have any simple ways of conveying their wants and needs to staff members at 
        universities. Additionally, staff have no easy way of collecting data and categorising them in order to see
        what students really enjoy about their lectures. Our client was UCL, a world-renowned university in the heart of
        London. They currently have an exisiting system that provides data based on submissions on a system known as Moodle
        but it lacks suitable measures for student feedback and engagement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="project_goals">
      <h3>Project Goals</h3>
      <p>Our project goal is to increase student engagement with staff members and allow staff at UCL to easily monitor how their students
        are doing in relation to their courses. In technical terms, our project is oriented around developing a responsive web
        application that serves both students and staff members.

      <h3>Client Requirements</h3>
        <p>An online meeting was arranged via Microsoft Teams with our clients.
          During the meeting, we received our list of requirements which consisted of things that must be implemented and some extras which
          can be implemented depending on our timeframe. Initially, multiple meetings were conducted in order to produce a clear MoSCoW and remove
          any ambiguities. Below are example questions that we asked the clients:
          <ul>
            <li>What type of application are we developing (desktop or mobile)?</li>
            <li>Is there any example applications that already exist?</li>
            <li>Is there a particular endpoint or server this application should work with? (Sharepoint e.g.)</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Scenarios</h3>
      <h4>Jon Brown</h4>
      <p>Jon is a CS student who is currently in 2nd year. He has a strong interest in quantum computing. He knows that his university has research currently ongoing in that area and he is unaware of whom to contact. He decided to use our web application to get further insight in this matter. He found it easy to navigate through the web application which contained a search form to ask him what topic area he is looking for. He found the hierarchical system informative and easy to understand. Using the same system he was able to find which staff member to approach to fix his license key issues. Every week he is further prompted by the system to give feedback on his current lectures, so the course can be improved towards his liking (i.e. help increase his course satisfaction).
      </p>
      <h4>Eva Smith</h4>
      <p>Eva Smith is a CS lecturer who is currently researching quantum computing. She knows that students are somewhat engaged via the use of an online system called Moodle. She wants to know which students are regularly attending their online lectures and she does not want to waste time with a conventional register during the online lecture. Therefore, she uses our web application to give a code to everyone who is attending, which would be then used by the students to confirm their attendance via our web application. Additionally, she wants feedback on how well she is performing in her lectures. The system contacts students via a chatbot weekly to get feedback. The system generates a word cloud using sentiment analysis and presents it to the lecturer.
